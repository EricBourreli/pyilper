        <p>HP-IL (Hewlett Packard Interface Loop) is a
        serial interconnection bus introduced by Hewlett-Packard
        in the early 1980s. It enabled the communication between
        peripheral devices such as printers, floppy disk drives
        etc. with programmable calculators such as the
        HP-41C, HP71B and HP-75C/D.</p>

        <p>The connection to PCs was realized by either an generic
        ISA bus card or a serial interface controller. As these
        devices are not avaibalbe any more, Jean-Francois Garnier
        published his <a href="http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/hpil/index.html">
        PIL-Box</a> project in 2009 to link a PC via USB to the
        HP-IL system.<p>

        <p>The PC operating system communicates with the PIL-Box as a 
        virtual serial device over USB. The PIL-Box reads incoming
        frames from the loop.</p>

        <p>pyPIL is a program that reads HP-IL frames from the
        PIL-Box, processes them by emulating some virtual HPIL
        devices, like a printer, a disk drive or a terminal and sends
        the processed frames back to the loop.</p>

        <p>The first program ILPER (HP-IL peripheral emulator) was
        written by Jean-Francois Garnier in VisualBasic. The current
        Version of ILPER is written in Visual C++ and is maintained
        by Christoph Gie&szlig;elink. pyILPER ist a Python version
        of ILPER with some modifications and enhencements.</p>

        <p>pyILPER provides the following virtual HP-IL devices in
        one application:<p>
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>a scope to watch the HP-IL traffic</li>
        <li>dumb line printer(s)</li>
        <li>mass storage device(s)</li>
        <li>terminal emulator</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>To user pyILPER you need at least the PIL-Box and a
        HP-IL controller like the HP-41 or HP-71B. Most fun you 
        will have with the HP-71B wich is a powerful device to
        control a HP-IL system.</p>

        <p>As of version 1.2.1 pyILPER supports 
        <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/hpil.htm">virtual HP-IL over TCP-IP</a>.        This feature is experimental. You may hook the
        <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/emu71.htm">HP-71B Emulator of
        Christph Gie&szlig;elink</a> with pyILPER.
        
        <p>pyILPER was written in pure Python 3 and its user interface
        was implemented with the Qt framework. Up to now pyILPER was
        only tested on Ubuntu LINUX 14.04 and Windows 7.</p>
