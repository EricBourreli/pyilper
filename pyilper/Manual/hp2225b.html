<h2 class="w3-text-teal">HP2225B Tab</h2>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Description</h3>
<p>This virtual HP-IL device emulates a HP2225B thermal printer.</p>

<p>HP-IL configuration:</p>
<table class="w3-table-all">
<tr><td>Accessory ID</td><td>0x23</td></tr>
<tr><td>Default Address</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Device ID</td><td>HP2225B</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This virtual HP-IL device emulates a HP2225B thermal printer. The formatted printer output is sent to a scrollable output window. The buffer size of the printer window is configurable can keep up to 50 pages of graphics or text. The content of the display buffer can be transferred to a high quality PDF file:</p>

<ul class="w3-ul">
<li>Push the <em>Clear</em> button to clear the scrollable printer output window. Note: this also resets your printer settings </li>
<li>Print a document on the printer. The formatted output is shown in the scrollable printer window</li>
<li>Generate a PDF file from the content of the scollable printe window.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> Line feeds are not visible in the scrollable display. However they trigger a page break in the PDF file.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Differences from the real device</h3>

<p>The emulated device differs from the original device in the following ways:</p>

<ul class="w3-ul">
<li>The HP2225B printer bitmap font is emulated with a monospaced outline font. Character sizes are close to those of the original printer.</li>

<li>Graphics dots are squares. Therefore graphic lines are less smoothe and less solid than those of the original printer output.</li>

<li>Printable output is generated as PDF file. The page size is limited to the dimensions of either the <em>Letter</em> or the <em>A4</em> format which is specified in the <em>pyILPER</em> system settings. Therefore the printer settings for page length and perforation skip have no effect.</li>

<li>The maximum horizontal size of the text area is 10 inches, which is equivalent to 80 lines at 8 lines/inch or 60 lines at 6 lines/inch. The text length can be changed within these limits. A smaller text are is vertically centered in the PDF file. Note: The PDF file is generated <em>only with the endmost text length setting!</em>. 

<li>The HP-IL printer status bytes always return the condition "ready to receive data" because the error conditions of the real device do not apply to the emulator.</li>

<li>Printer controls for selftest or bidirectional printing have no effect.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Issues</h3>

<ul class="w3-ul">
<li>On macOS stretched characters do not render correctly. This is probably a problem with the Qt version for this operating system. As a work around the expanded font is displayed with unstretched characters but the correct character spacing on macOS.</li>
<li>The alternate control mode is not implemented.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Device controls</h3>

<p>The HP2225B printer tab has the following controls:</p>

<ul class="w3-ul">
<li><em>Clear:</em> Resets the device in the same way as a HP-IL device clear. The scrollable display is cleared and the emulated printer is put to a default condition.</li>
<li><em>LF:</em> Does a line feed on the printer. If the button is pushed for more than half a second multiple line feeds are generated until the button is released. </li>
<li><em>FF:</em> Does a form feed on the printer.</li>
<li><em>PDF:</em> Generate a PDF file with the content of the printer display
buffer. You may choose a filename, a header and the number of columns (1-3).</li>

<li><em>Device enabled</em> checkbox: If checked, the virtual HP-IL printer is
available and can be used as HP-IL device. The HP-IL loop must
always be reconfigured after activation or deactivation.
</li>
<li><em>Log HP2225B</em> checkbox: Activates writing printer output to the file
<em>Devicename.log</em> in the <em>pyILPER</em> working directory. Output is 
always appended to that file. A time stamp in the file marks the start and the
end of each logging. The log file is closed automatically on program 
termination. Note: only printable text is logged to the file.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Tab configuration menu</h3>
<ul class="w3-ul">
<li><em>Screen width:</em> You can set the width of the scrollable printer display to 640, 960 or 1280 pixel.<li>
<li><em>Buffer size:</em> Size of the scrollable printer window in pages (approximately).</li>
<li><em>Print color:</em> Select black, red, blue or green color to emulate the color ink cartridges which were available for that device. The color change takes effect immediately for the whole scrollable printer window.</li>
<li><em>Log buffering</em>: enable or disable buffering of the log file. If log buffering is off the log file output is flushed to disk after an end of line
was encountered. This enables watching the log file output but may decrease
the execution speed of <em>pyILPER</em> considerably.</li>
</ul>
