<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Release Notes for <em>pyILPER</em> 1.6.0</h2>

<p><em>pyILPER</em> 1.6.0 introduces an emulated HP82162A printer as new devices and includes major improvements of the user interface.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">New features and enhancements</h3>

<ul class="w3-ul">
<li>The HP82162A printer is now included as virtual HP-IL device.
The device provides high quality output to a PDF file. Add this device with the
<em>Virtual HP-IL device configuration</em> in the file menu.</li>

<li>Resizing the main window of <em>pyILPER</em> now adjusts the number of lines of the printer, scope and drive directory automatically. This also applies to the size of the plotter viewport. The dimensions of the <em>pyILPER</em> main window is restored at start of the application.</li>

<li>Any change of GUI related configuration parameters (font sizes, terminal color scheme, number of columns of the terminal widget) now effects immediately and does not require a restart of the application any more.</li>

<li>The terminal, printer and scope now support copying selected text to the system clipboard. The terminal supports pasting text from the system clipboard.</li>

<li>Barcodes of HP-41 program and SDATA files can now be created as PDF files from the context menu of the directory listing.</li>

<li>Terminal, scope and printers got mouse wheel scrolling support. Note: the focus must be in the output window.</li>

<li>A PDF file of the directory listing can now be created from the tool menu of the drive tab.</li>

<li>The scope got an option to display the frames as hex codes.</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Changes and incompatibilities</h3>

<ul class="w3-ul">
<li>If a virtual device is re enabled again, its HP-IL address is reset
to zero if any HP-IL operation that changed addresses of other devices 
(AAU, AAD, AEP or AES) happened in the meantime. You must reconfigure
the loop (run <em>PILTERM</em>) to access the device again. <b>This prevents 
duplicate HP-IL addresses of virtual devices which can cause data 
corruption of LIF media</b>.</li>

<li>The <em>PILTERM</em> utility was updated to version 2.1. This version
deassigns any <em>DISPLAY IS, PRINTER IS</em> and <em>KEYBOARD IS</em>
assignments before issuing a <em>RESTORE IO</em> to avoid possible data 
corruptions (see <a class="w3-hover-black" href="drive.html">the caveat section here</a>. All users are encouraged to update to this version. <b>This
prevents assignments of the display, printer or keyboard device to a
virtual drive which can cause data corruption of LIF media.</b></li>

<li>For this reason the default <em>pyILPER</em> configurations now puts the virtual drive tabs at the end of the tab menu and therefore at the end of the 
virtual device chain.</li>

<li>The paper size option was moved from the plotter configuration to the
<em>pyILPER</em> configuration in the file menu. This parameter now controls
the medium size of all PDF output as well as important plotter settings. 
The default for this parameter is A4. <b>Reconfiguration required if the letter format is used!</b></li>

<li>The way to disable scrolling changed as well. Set the scroll up buffer size
to the favored number of lines. Then resize the main window until all lines are
displayed. The minimum number of lines of the scroll up buffer is 24.</li>

<li>The <em>terminal size</em> configuration parameter was replaced by the
<em>terminal width</em> parameter which specifies the number of columns
(80 or 120). <b>Reconfiguration required!</b></li>

<li><em>pyILPER</em> needs the updated version 1.7.7 of the <em>LIFUTILS</em>. Previous installed versions of the <em>LIFUTILS</em> must be updated.</li>
</ul>
