<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Release Notes for <em>pyILPER</em> 1.7.1</h2>
<ul class="w3-ul">

<li>The tabbed virtual HP-IL devices can be undocked and moved to
floating, resizeable windows by pressing the undock button in the right
corner of the tab bar. Clicking the close button of a floating window
docks the virtual device into the tab again.
</li>

<li> The configuration of a device tab/window is now implemented by
cascading menus which can be called with the <em>Configuration</em> button
in the bottom right corner. To clean up the user interface
all configuration options with the exception of device enable/disable or 
logging on/off were moved to the cascading menu.
Global parameters which affect all device windows or tabs in question are 
configured in the main <em>pyILPER</em> configuration dialog as before.</li>

<li>The number of terminal columns, the color scheme and the number of lines in
the scroll buffer are now configured individually in the configuration menu of 
the device tab/window. Changing the scroll buffer size clears the display but
does not require a restart of the application any more.</li>

<li>All GUI font size parameters can be configure either at the 
<em>pyILPER</em> application level or individually for a single tab/window.</li>

<li>A new configuration option allows to control whether log output is always
flushed to disk after an end of line was encountered. Turning buffering off 
may slow down the program considerably. This option can be configured individually for each device tab/window that supports logging.</li>

<li>The pixel size of HP82162A display is now configurable.</li>

<li>Terminal, printer, scope and HP82162A keep now their scroll position on resize.</li>

<li>The selection feature of the terminal, printer and scope now supports 
autoscrolling.</li>

<li>The scope, printer and terminal tab/window got a display size 
indicator.</li>

<li>The file management functions of the drive tab/window are now accessible
by push buttons. Note: These buttons are only accessilbe if the 
<em>LIFUTILS</em> are installed and the drive is <b>disabled</b>.</li>

<li>The external view window of the virtual HP7470A plotter was removed. It
is not needed any more, because the tab can be undocked as a floating 
window.</li>
<li>Allow smaller font sizes for the directory listing and the terminal
widget.</li>

<li>UTF-8 text files created by <em>pyILPER</em> had a byte ordering mark (BOM)
at the beginning of the file to avoid encoding detection problems with some 
older Windows programs. Hence UTF-8 text files with BOM are not compatible with
the <em>LIFUTILS</em>. Therefore this feature was now entirely removed on Linux and MacOS. 
On Windows the addition of a BOM can be enabled in the <em>pyILPER</em> configuration menu. Enable this option if other Windows programs do not recognize the
UTF-8 encoding of <em>pyILPER</em> log files correctly. <b>Note:</b> 
Since the BOM is inserted at the beginning of a file all log files must be
removed to have an effect when changing this option.</li>
<li>Added the "paper" colorscheme (black on white) for terminal, printer and scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a class="w3-hover-black" href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> for a full list of changes.</p>

<p>Release 1.7.0 was cancelled because a bug fix was needed.</p>
